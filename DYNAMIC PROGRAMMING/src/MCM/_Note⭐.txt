This is another classification of dp pattern.
=> Dp on grid.            (MCM)

WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN MOST MCM VARIATION PROBLEM ??
-> You could be given an array or string.
-> You will use two variables i and j which reperesents starting and ending point.
-> You will need the third variable k which is used to partition the string or array 
   it usually go from i to j.
-> You divid the problem into smaller problem and find out solution 1 and solution 2
   with the help of solution 1 and solution 2 you will find another solution, solution 3.
   And using these you have to return the final ans according to question. (=,- or anything).

How to recursive code of mcm variant question would look like:

    mcm(arr/str, i, j) {
        // base case 
        if(i >= j)

        for(k = i to k < j)   // depends on question there might be slight up down
            int ans1 = mcm(i, k);  // can be i to k-1 depends on question
            int ans1 = mcm(k+1, j);  
            int ans3 = ...;
            comapare(tempAns, ans)
    }
