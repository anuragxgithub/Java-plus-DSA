Memoization (Top-Down Approach):

-> In memoization, the approach starts from the top (the original problem) and works its way
   down to smaller subproblems.
-> It's called "top-down" because you start with the main problem and recursively break it 
   down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem only once and then storing its result
(memoization) to avoid redundant calculations.
-> In other words, you start from the top (the original problem) and then go down to solve 
   subproblems as needed.


Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):

-> In tabulation, the approach starts from the bottom (the smallest subproblems) and works
   its way up to the solution of the main problem.
-> It's called "bottom-up" because you start with the smallest subproblems  
   (usually by initializing a table with solutions to these subproblems) and iteratively
   build up solutions for larger subproblems until you reach the solution for the main problem.
-> In other words, you start from the bottom (the base cases or smallest subproblems) and
   then iteratively build up solutions for larger subproblems until you reach the solution
   for the main problem.

Here's a summary:
Memoization: Top-down approach where you start solving the main problem and recursively solve
             smaller subproblems, memoizing their results to avoid redundant calculations.
Tabulation: Bottom-up approach where you start solving the smallest subproblems and iteratively
            build up solutions for larger subproblems until you reach the solution for the main
            problem.

Both approaches achieve the same goal of solving dynamic programming problems by breaking 
them down into smaller
subproblems, but they differ in the direction in which they construct the solutions.
