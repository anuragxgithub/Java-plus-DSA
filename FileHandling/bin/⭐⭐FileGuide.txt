Overall summary :
Stream : a sequece/collection of data.

When we talk about file handling in java we first talk about the two types of streams:
1) Byte Stream : Suitable for handling raw binary data / non-textual data. But that does not mean
it can't handle textual file.
Byte Stream has wot classes for input and output.
  1) InputStream 
  2) OutputStream
  and these are two abstract classes which have multiple subclasses which we use accordingly to
  read and write data.
  InputStream: and its SUBCLASSES (FileInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, etc.) for reading binary data.
  OutputStream: and its subclasses (FileOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, etc.) for writing binary data.

2) Character Stream : Suitable for handling the textual data like .txt files.
Character Stream has two classes for input and output.
  1) Reader
  2) Writer
  and these are two abstract classes which have multiple subclasses which we use accordingly to
  read and write text data.
  Reader: and its subclasses (FileReader, BufferedReader, etc.) for reading text data.
  Writer: and its subclasses (FileWriter, BufferedWriter, etc.) for writing text data.

NOTE:
If the class name is having 'InputStream' for reading or 'OutputStream' for writing in its name
then that class is used to represent the Byte streams.
Eg: ByteArrayOutputStream, FileInputStream, etc.

If the class name is having 'Reader; for reading or 'Writer' for writing in its name
then that class is used to represent Character streams.
Eg: FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, etc.
