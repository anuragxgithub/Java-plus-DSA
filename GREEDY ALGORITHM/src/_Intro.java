        DEFINITON :
        Greedy algorithm is the prblem solving technique where we "make the locally optimum choice at each stage"
        and hope to achieve a global optimum.
        But it is not guaranteed that final result will be optimum everytime.

        Greedy algorithms are generally used for optimization problems 
        like if we need to find the maximum or minimum as final value in the problem.
        Usually greedy algos involve sorting.

        It don't have any fixed rule like other algos rather its implementation depends on the problem given.
        It might be possible that you already solved some of the greedy based problems unknowingly.
