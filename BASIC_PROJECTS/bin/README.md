# CODSOFT
This is a repository of my projects which was given to me during my internship in CODSOFT.
*DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS*
1) Project 1 is a simple Java console game called "Guess The Number." In this game, the player's objective is to guess a random number generated by the computer within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player after each guess, helping them to narrow down their choices. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.

2) Project 2 is a simple program to calculate the grade of a student in this program we ask the student to enterhis/her marks obtained in each subject. With that data we calculate total marks and percentage and with the grading rules we provided student a grade based on the percentage he/she got. At last we will display total marks obtained, percentage and the grade.

3) Project 3 is a Java program which simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface. Users can check balances,deposit and withdraw money, view transaction histories, and change the ATM PIN. Default settings include a balance of Rs. 2000 and a PIN of 1234. Run the ATM class to start. Use responsibly for learning purposes.
Implementation:
The ATM system consists of two main classes: ATM and BankAccount. The ATM class handles user interactions, while the BankAccount class manages account-related functionalities and transaction history.
