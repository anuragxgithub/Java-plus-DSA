These are thse questions which I solved while learning the tree concepts and about its questions:
EasyPeasies 
1. LeetCode 102
2. LeetCode 637  (Google)
3. Level Order Successor of a node. (Google)   
4. LeetCode 103   (fang)
5. LeetCode 107   (fang)
6. LeetCode 116    (Google London)
7. LeetCode 199   (fb, amzon,etc)
8. LeetCode 993  (FMA)
9. LeetCode 101    (LinkedIn, Fb, Microsoft, etc)

----DFS(PreOder, PostOrder & InOrder stuff) Thing started from here----

10. LeetCode 543 (Faang)
11. LeetCode 226 (Faang)  easypeasy
12. LeetCode 104 (Faang, linkedIn, etc)
13. LeetCode 108 (Fag)  
14. LeetCode 114  (fb, amazon, microsoft)
15 LeetCode 98  (FAANG)  Good Question.   In these types of questions have patience and use pen and paper properly. Have believe in yourself.
16. LeetCode 236 (FAANG)  (Important Question)	           Challenges your understanding of recursion
17. LeetCode 230 (Amazon, LinkedIn)  (Good Question)  Challenges your understanding of recursion
NOTE: Practice Path sum questions properly.
18. LeetCode 105 (Many companies)  Important question   (you can try to do the same thing with inorder and postorder)
19. LeetCode 297 (Important Question)  Link to understand the problem is given below:
https://youtu.be/Qtf8ieq3zco?si=QxkGQtEF66iz2s3R (this is to understand only my solution is in java and uses queue)  also done here in this package you can debug if you want in file name : TreeNode4
Copy paste the same code to quetion LeetCode 449   EasyPeasy
Thats why its clever move to undersand & solve this question and don't forget bcz same thing will apply for all the questions like this.

20. LeetCode 112  (Amazon)
21. Leetcode 129 (FMA)
22. LeetCode 124 (ALL COMPANIES) (Practice and Understand this problem)
23. Done in this package. Que: (given Path exist or not from root to leaf)  FILE NAME : TreeNode2

THIS BELOW ONE IS ACTUALLY CHALLENGING QUESTION
24. https://youtu.be/9D-vP-jcc-Y?si=APZ2n8H75fMhOlku   TIME STAMP : 4:26:38

25. Done in this package : Iterative approach of DFS using stack.  FILE NAME : TreeNode3
