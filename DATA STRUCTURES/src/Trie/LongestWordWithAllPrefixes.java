---------THIS QUESTION IS IN LEETCODE PREMIUM---------

Given an array of strings words, find the longest string in words such that every prefix 
of it is also in words.

For example, let words = ["a", "app", "ap"]. The string "app" has prefixes "ap" and "a", 
all of which are in words.
Return the string described above. If there is more than one string with the same 
length, return the lexicographically smallest one, and if no string exists, return "".

Input: words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"] 
Output: "apple" 
Explanation: Both "apple" and "apply" have all their prefixes in words. But we want
             lexicographically smallest so "apple".

APPRAOCH:
1. AFTER HEARING PREFIX IN QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD THINK OF TRIE.
2. SO HERE THE LOGIC IS SIMPLE WE WILL FIND LONGEST WORD WHICH HAS SAME PREFIX.
   THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO FIND THE LONGEST WORD WHERE FOR EACH CHAR IN WORD EOW = TRUE.
   BCZ FOR "EACH" CHAR OF WORD (EOW = TRUE) REPRESENTS THAT WE HAVE ALL WORDS IN GIVEN ARRAY
   WHICH IS PREFIX OF THAT PARTICUALR WORD.
   NODE IS NOT NULL AND END OF WORD IS TRUE FOR EACH LETER 

                          Root
                           |
                         __|__
                         |   |
                       T a   b
                        /     \
                     T p       a
                      /         \
                  T  p           n
                    /             \
                 T l               a
                  / \               \
               T e   y T             n
                                      \
                                       a T
    Here the logest word whose all chars has a eow in trie is apple and apply but we want 
    "apple" bcz lexicographically smallest.
