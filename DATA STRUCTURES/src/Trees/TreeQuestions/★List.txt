  LeetCode 105  LeetCode 106 (many companies) ⭐
  Explanation is present in this package. (You can use HashMap instead of using findPos
  method bcz that will take constant time in find pos)

   Above 2 is more imp than this one.

13. LeetCode 108 (Fag)  
14.   (fb, amazon, microsoft)
15 LeetCode 98  (FAANG)  Good Question.   In these types of questions have patience and use pen and paper properly. Have believe in yourself.
16. LeetCode 236 (FAANG)  (Important Question)	           Challenges your understanding of recursion
17. LeetCode 230 (Amazon, LinkedIn)  (Good Question)  Challenges your understanding of recursion
NOTE: Practice Path sum questions properly.
19. LeetCode 297 (Important Question)  Link to understand the problem is given below:
https://youtu.be/Qtf8ieq3zco?si=QxkGQtEF66iz2s3R (this is to understand only my solution is in java and uses queue)  also done here in this package you can debug if you want in file name : TreeNode4
Copy paste the same code to quetion LeetCode 449   EasyPeasy
Thats why its clever move to undersand & solve this question and don't forget bcz same thing will apply for all the questions like this.

23. Done in this package. Que: (given Path exist or not from root to leaf)  FILE NAME : TreeNode2

THIS BELOW ONE IS ACTUALLY CHALLENGING QUESTION
