ðŸ’  KOSARAJU's Algorithm Explained: Finding Strongly Connected Components ðŸ’ 
Kosaraju's Algorithm is a powerful tool for identifying and counting the number of Strongly Connected Components
(SCCs) in a Directed Graph. In directed graphs, not all connected components are strongly connected, making this
algorithm particularly valuable.
Obviously in Undirected Graphs all components are already strongly connected.

ðŸ’  Understanding Strongly Connected Components ðŸ’ 
In graph theory, a strongly connected component is a "set of vertices" where there exists a directed path from any
vertex to any other vertex within the same component. Essentially, every vertex in the SCC is reachable from every
other vertex through directed edges.

ðŸ’  The 3-Step Algorithm ðŸ’ 
1.Get Nodes in Stack (Topological Sort):
    Start by performing a topological sort to obtain a stack of nodes. This step ensures that nodes are processed in an 
    order conducive to identifying strongly connected components.
2.Transpose the Graph:
    Reverse the direction of edges in the original graph to create the transpose graph. This step is crucial for the
    subsequent DFS traversal.
3. DFS on Transpose Graph According to Stack Nodes:
    Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the transpose graph using the nodes in the order they are stored in the stack.
    This traversal helps unveil the strongly connected components.

STEPS-
1. GET NODES IN STACK (TOPOLOGICAL SORT)
2. TRANSPOSE THE GRAPH       "(Reverse the direction of edges transpose is ready)"
3. DO DFS ACCORDING TO STACK NODES(in the order they are stored) ON "TRANSPOSE GRAPH".
