 * -> Dijkstra's algo does not guarantee correctness for cases when weight of the graphs can be negative.
 * -> So in this case we use Bellman Ford Algorithm.
 * -> Bellman Ford works on DP (Dynamic Programming).
 * -> Time complexity of Dijkstra's Algo(E+ Elog(V)) is less than Bellman Ford(V*E) algo so we'll always prefer
 * dijkstra when wt in graph is positive.
 * 
 * ---- BELLMAN FORD ALGO ----
 * "The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a dynamic programming-based approach for finding the shortest paths in a weighted 
 * graph. It starts by assuming an initial distance of infinity for all vertices except the source vertex, which is
 * set to zero. It then iteratively relaxes the edges (updating distance estimates) for each vertex until the shortest
 * paths are determined. The algorithm continues this process for a number of iterations equal to the number of vertices
 * minus one (V-1)."
 * 
 * STEPS / APPROACH
 * 1. Start with initialising the distance in dist arry for each vertex as infinity except the src.
 * 2. Now, just run a loop to visit all the edges and for all the edges peform relaxation(updating dist. estimates).
 * Do this until the shortest path get determined.
 * 3. And it will be determined if we do relaxation for each vertex V-1 times.

/*
 * NOTE: 
 * -> BELLMAN FORD ALGO DOES NOT WORK FOR "NEGATIVE WEIGHT CYCLE".
 * -> Negative wt Cycle : means when cycle is getting formed from edges a,b and c. If wtOf(a+b+c) < 0 that is called 
 * negative weight cycle.
 * -> Why don't work? 
 * because any such cycles(negative wt cycles) in graph, it indicates that the graph has no well-defined shortest paths. 
 * if you try to find the path of such cycles it will keep updating everytime in loop everytime giving lesser dist.
 * 
 * Ideally there should not be any updation in dis of vertices after V-1 iterations.
 * If the values are still updating after V-1 updating that means negativ wt cycle exists. To know this just add one more
 * inner for loop after V-1's loop got end if the dist of nodes are still updating that means negative cycle exist.
 * 
 * 
 * ONE MORE QUESTION:
 * Why Bellman ford is telling us to iterate for V-1 ??
 * Simple, because for any two nodes(lets say 1 & 2) the maximun number of possible nodes required to reach from node 1
 * to 2 is (V-1) so it makes sures that we don't even miss the longest path. So it is designed so that we don't 
 * miss any path and bring the least dist required to reach node 2 after trying out all the paths.
