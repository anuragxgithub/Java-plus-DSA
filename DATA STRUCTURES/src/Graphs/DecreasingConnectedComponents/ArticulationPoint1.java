/*
 * ----> ARTICULATION POINT <----
 * "A vertex v is an articulation point (also called cut vertex) if removing v (& its edges) increases the number of
 * connected components."
 * 
 * APPLICATIONS OF ARTICULATION POINT:
 * Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split
 * the network into 2 or more components. They are useful for designing reliable "networks".
 * 
 * HERE WE'LL DISCUSS THE NAIVE APPROACH:
 * In this approach we would simply just remove 1 vertex and check how many connected components are there in the graph
 * after removing it. If it woud be greater than 1 than obviously it would be called as an Articulation Point.
 * And we'll repeat the same thing for each vertex. Simple.
 * 
 * So here is my own implementation of finding AP in a graph using naive appraoch and this appraoch is correct.
 * 
 * So only thing in this approach is that how to actually remove the node, lol its simple just before the dfs mark it
 * as visited. The problem is solved now dfs will not consider this node and hence it is kind of removed.
 * Also calculate the components on removing the current node. DONE
 * 
 * But is is not efficient bcz the time complexity is : O(V * (V+E)).
 *
