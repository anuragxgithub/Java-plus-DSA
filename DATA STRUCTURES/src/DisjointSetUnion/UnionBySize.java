/*
Note: Size of a binary tree is the sum of number of nodes connected to it. 

UNION BY SIZE:
Each element initially belongs to its own set, and the size of each set is initialized to 1.

UNION BY SIZE STRATEGY:
Tree Representation: Each subset is represented as a tree, where each node corresponds to an element in the set, and the
root of the tree represents the set's representative.
Size Information: The size of a set is stored in its root node, indicating the number of elements in the set.

OPERATION:
Uniting Sets (Union Operation):
When performing a union operation, the algorithm compares the sizes of the trees representing the sets.
The root of the smaller-sized tree is made a child of the root of the larger-sized tree.
This strategy minimizes the resulting tree size and prevents the formation of skewed trees(left or right).

PURPOSE:
Balancing Tree Heights: By choosing the smaller-sized tree to merge under the larger-sized tree, the strategy helps
"balance the heights of the trees"(union by size only prevents tree from becoming too deep) in the DSU structure.

/*
 * NOTE:
 * TIME COMPLEXITY:
 * The time complexity will remain same as of time complexity of union by rank. i.e,
 * O(4Î±)   which is as good as constant time.
 * No one is going to ask you about alpha bcz it has a huge derivation.
 * 
 * SPACE COMPLEXITY:
 * O(n)
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE: 
 * WE CAN USE ANY EITHER UNION BY RANK OR UNION BY SIZE.
 * BUT I'LL USE "UNION BY SIZE" BCZ THAT IS MORE INTUITIVE TO ME.
 * 
 * 
 * UNION BY WEIGHT:
 * "Union by weight" is another way of describing the same strategy as "union by size." The term "weight" is often
 * used to represent the size of the tree or the number of elements in the subtree rooted at a particular node. So,
 * in practice, "union by weight" is essentially the same as "union by size."
