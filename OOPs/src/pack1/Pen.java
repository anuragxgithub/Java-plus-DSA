//Package :
//A package acts as a container for classes. A package is used to organize related classes, interfaces and
// other resources.It provides a mechanism for grouping related code and helps in organizing large codebases.
// Similar to how folders are used to organize files on a computer.
//(Basically same as folder but stores classes in it).
//It prevents the collision of classes whose names are same and are stored somewhere else.

package pack1;

public class Pen {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Look here we created a class name Pen which already exist in this project, but it is not giving error.
        System.out.println(12);
    }
}
