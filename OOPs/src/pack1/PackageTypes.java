 Here are some of the most commonly used built-in packages in Java:

1) java.lang: This package is automatically imported in every Java program. It contains fundamental classes
   and interfaces that are essential to the core functionality of the Java language, such as Object
   (the root of all classes), String, Math, and exceptions like RuntimeException.

2) java.util: This package contains utility classes and data structures that are commonly used in Java
   programs. It includes classes for handling collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.),
   date and time manipulation (Date, Calendar, SimpleDateFormat), input/output operations (Scanner, Formatter),
   and more.

3) java.io: This package provides classes for performing input and output operations in Java.It includes
   classes for reading and writing data to files (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, FileReader, FileWriter),
   as well as classes for handling input and output streams (InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer).

NO NEED TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT THESE GIVEN BELOW

4) java.net: This package contains classes and interfaces for networking in Java. It allows you to create
   network connections, send and receive data over the network, and work with URLs. It includes classes like
   URL, HttpURLConnection, Socket, and ServerSocket.

5) java.awt: This package provides classes for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) in Java.
   It includes classes for creating windows, buttons, labels, and other GUI components. However,
   since Java 1.2, the Java Foundation Classes (javax.swing package) have become more popular for
    GUI development.

6) java.util.concurrent: This package provides classes and interfaces for writing concurrent and
   multithreaded programs in Java. It includes utilities for managing thread pools, executing asynchronous
   tasks, and synchronizing access to shared resources.


These are just a few examples of the many built-in packages available in Java. Java's extensive standard
library provides developers with a rich set of tools and functionalities to build a wide variety of
applications.
