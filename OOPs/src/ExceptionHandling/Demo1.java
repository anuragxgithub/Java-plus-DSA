package ExceptionHandling;
//Exception handling in Java refers to the mechanism of dealing with runtime errors or exceptional conditions
//that may occur during program execution.
//Help us to recover from errors and prevent our program from terminating abruptly.
/*
Checked Exceptions: These are the exceptions that are checked at compile-time. If a method throws a checked
exception, it must declare it using the throws keyword in its method signature, or the exception must be
caught and handled using a try-catch block. Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException,
 and ClassNotFoundException.

Unchecked Exceptions: These exceptions are not checked at compile-time, meaning the compiler doesn't enforce
catching or declaring them. They are typically caused by programming errors or exceptional conditions that
are difficult to recover from. Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and ArithmeticException(eg. / by 0).

//        }
//try must be used with catch or finally can't be used alone simple logic.

//Exception handling enables you to control the flow of your program in the face of exceptional conditions.
