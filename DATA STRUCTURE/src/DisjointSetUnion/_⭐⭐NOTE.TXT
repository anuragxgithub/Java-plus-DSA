WHILE CALCULATING TIME COMPLEXITY HERE WE DIDN'T CONSIDER TIME OF FOR LOOP WHICH TAKES O(n).
I only discussed about the find and union operation complexity and time complexity of union ultimately depends upon
find method operation.

TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY OF 
DISJOINT SET DATA STRUCTURE WITH (UNION BY RANK OR UNION BY SIZE) WITH PATH COMPRESSION INCLUDING EVERYTHING IS:

Time:   O(n * 4Î±)   ~ O(n)
Space:  O(n)
